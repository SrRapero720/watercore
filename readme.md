[MemoryLeakFix](https://github.com/fxmorin/MemoryLeakFix) mod but IN FORGE (read incompatibilities section).
- Provides a Lazy API to interact with Forge Registries and other mods APIs (Luckperms included)
- Randomly fix a lot of little issues from other mods.
- Adds a MixinTrace in your crash reports (port wrapped of [CraftyCrashes](https://github.com/Chocohead/Crafty-Crashes) and [MixinTrace](https://github.com/comp500/mixintrace))
- Change language or mipmap level no stun the game.

## Special Compatibilities
- [Vanishmod](https://github.com/RedstoneDubstep/Vanishmod) - Uses configured Join/Leave message format
- [FancyMenu](https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu) - Utility placeholders added

## Incompatibilities
- Saturn (My mod do the same)
- Corail Tombstone (No support)
- FTB Ranks (breaks our chat format and player name format)
- [VMP-Forge](https://github.com/SrRapero720/VMP-forge) (only with WATERCoRE 1.3 and below)
- MemoryLeakFix (My mod do the same)

## MemoryLeakFix Disclaimer
No, I no C&P MemoryLeakFix code or wrap my own port here. Before they release a forge version 
I ask [if can I make a port of the mod](https://github.com/fxmorin/MemoryLeakFix/issues/66) using the same name and keep the same
code (just porting stuff), and the owner says no, because forge maybe fix leaks, so I made my own fixes in forge. But currently they
release a Forge version... and no, I don't want to delete all my hard work because they release a forge version...

WATERCoRE do the same leak fixes for 1.18.2, if you have WATERCoRE you don't need that mod
