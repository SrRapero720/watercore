- MemoryLeakFix (My mod do the same)

## MemoryLeakFix Disclaimer
No, I no C&P MemoryLeakFix code or wrap my own port here. Before they release a forge version 
I ask [if can I make a port of the mod](https://github.com/fxmorin/MemoryLeakFix/issues/66) using the same name and keep the same
code (just porting stuff), and the owner says no, because forge maybe fix leaks, so I made my own fixes in forge. But currently they
release a Forge version... and no, I don't want to delete all my hard work because they release a forge version...

WATERCoRE do the same leak fixes for 1.18.2, if you have WATERCoRE you don't need that mod
